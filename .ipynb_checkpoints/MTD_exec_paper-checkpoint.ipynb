    "The concept of stimulating 2D magnets with a brief laser pulse presents exceptional prospects for gaining insights into the underlying interactions, a crucial element in modern materials science design. This holds significance in enhancing our foundational comprehension of physical principles and exploring highly non-equilibrium routes that may prove advantageous for practical applications, including solid-state data storage and signal processing. Two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) magnets represent a captivating and rapidly evolving frontier in condensed matter physics and materials science. These materials, often composed of stacked layers held together by weak van der Waals forces, have ignited a profound shift in our understanding of magnetism and magnetic materials. Unlike their traditional bulk counterparts, 2D vdW magnets are characterized by their atomically thin nature, which imparts remarkable physical and electronic properties that challenge conventional paradigms. The recent finding of long-range magnetic order in 2D vdW magnets such as $\\rm{CrI_3}$, $\\rm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6(CGT)}$ and $\\rm{Fe_3GeTe_2}$ open new avenues in the field of spintronics leading to new magneto-optical and magnetoelectric applications. Gong $\\it{et} \\ {\\it{al}.}$ showed 2D ferromagnetism in $\\rm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$ down to two layers using the magneto-optical technique. In a recent work, May et al. reported ferromagnetism near room temperature in bulk and atomically thin samples of $\\rm{Fe_3GeTe_2}$. Gaining a profound understanding of spin dynamics is imperative for harnessing the full potential of these materials in practical applications. A pivotal factor contributing to the magnetization dynamics we observe lies in the intricate interplay between intrinsic elements, such as exchange coupling between spins, and extrinsic factors, like heat conductivity.\n",

    "The predominant focus of current research endeavors centers around unraveling the intricacies of the demagnetization process following a brief laser pulse. However, there remains an ongoing quest to ascertain the fate of magnetization over extended timescales. In the research field of optically excited magnetization dynamics, the prediction and control of magnetization dynamics on long nanosecond (ns) is essential for possible technical implementations.} This exploration can be traced back to the pioneering work of Vaterlaus et al., who first unveiled that the demagnetization time of gadolinium approximated 100 picoseconds. In the subsequent year, in 1996,  followed by a remagnetization on a long time scale after a short femtosecond laser pulse using a time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) technique. Intriguingly, their investigation also uncovered a profound aspect of CGT's behavior—a type-II dynamics-which underwent a transformation to type-I dynamics as fluence levels increased.  Koopmans et al. were pioneers in introducing the theoretical framework known as the Microscopic Three-Temperature Model (M3TM) based on electron-phonon scattering mediated spin flip to understand the main mechanism driving the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in 3d  ferromagnets. Later, Griepe et al. demonstrated that electron-phonon mediated spin flips indeed constituted the driving force behind ultrafast  magnetization dynamics in all three 3d ferromagnetic materials: nickel, iron, and cobalt. Notably, their findings required fewer fitting parameters. \n",

    "The realm of material engineering, especially in the context of combining 2D materials, presents an invaluable platform to look into a plethora of physical phenomena. One particularly noteworthy phenomenon under investigation is the dissipation of energy within low-dimensional nanoscale materials. This research holds profound significance as it paves the way for insights crucial to the development of future miniaturized devices. 2D materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), black phosphorus (BP), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can be used as substrates to achieve atomically smooth surfaces that are free of dangling bonds and charge traps, thereby enabling homogeneous thermal spreading. As an illustration, insulating hBN possess a remarkably high in-plane thermal conductivity, reaching up to 360 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$, in contrast to semiconducting 2D materials like BP, MoS2, and WSe2, which exhibit significantly lower thermal conductivities, typically falling below 100 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$. Hence, it becomes imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of various factors, including heat conductivity, heat capacity, and external fluences, on the magnetization dynamics of 2D vdW magnets when encapsulated by different substrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we investigate the importance of thermal properties of magnetic material and substrates in stacked 2D vdW samples and reveal that the timescale of magnetization recovery can be engineered by varying substrates and thickness of the magnetic material."

    "Our theoretical approach to understanding ultrafast magnetization dynamics is based on the Microscopic Three-Temperature Model (M3TM). In this framework, the ultrafast laser pulse $S(z,t)$ interacts with the itinerant electronic subsystem in the electric dipole approximation. Upon fast thermalization of the electron system by Coulomb scattering, the pulse causes a  substantial elevation in the electronic temperature $T_e$. Electron-Phonon scattering processes allow an exchange of energy and equilibration of $T_e$ and the phonon bath, characterized by it's temperature $T_p$. Depth dependent laser absorption leads to temperature gradients in the sample that cause diffusion processes in both baths. Energetic cost of demagnetization gets compensated by the electronic system. All interactions in this thermal picture can be captured in the modified Two Temperature Model (2TM)\n",

    "The sample class enables the construction of an arbitrary stacking of the above defined layers of materials. Upon combining different materials, interfacial constants of the heat conductivities must be chosen, where insulating substrate and cap layers only allow for phononic diffusion at the surface. Furthermore, this class holds methods to filter nonmagnetic and insulating layers, optimizing both performance and memory usage for the computation and to construct arrays of the material parameters for each layer of the sample. These arrays are saved in a numpy format, allowing for efficient numerical computations with the $\\it{numpy}$ module."

    "\n",
    "Temperature initialization involves merely the assignment of an ambient temperature to the phonon temperature $tp0$ of all layers of the sample and to the electron temperature $te0$ of all layers in the sample that contain itinerant electrons. This is carried out calling the function $\\it{SimDynamics.initialize\\_temperature()}$. The magnetization is initialized in  two steps, first assigning a fully polarized ferromagnetic spin configuration $fss0$ to all magnetic layers (calling $\\it{SimDynamics.initialize\\_spin\\_configuration()}$) and then equilibrating them dynamically to the mean field constellation at the initial temperature (calling $\\it{SimDynamics.equilibrate\\_mag(fss0, te0, tp0, ^{**}kwargs)}$). This process is sped up by increasing the magnetization rate parameter significantly in the quilibration phase. Note that the separated equilibration process is not only advantageous for performance but also a necessity, as the feedback term $\\dot{Q}_{es}$ that energetically couples electron temperature and spin configuration is surpressed in this phase, guaranteeing  correct initial temperature and magnetization.\n",

The differentail equations at hand can be solved in this way by flattening and joining the arrays of electronic and phononic temperatures as well as spin configurations, defining a function that includes the compuation of all their increments, separating the data for computation and joining them all together into a one-dimensional output in the end. The integrated solver uses adaptive timesteps for the computation. To assure convergence and good results, both the timesteps of evaluation and computation of increments can be adjusted. Therefore, a timegrid for the evaluation is created, which is done in three steps here. The first phase of the simulation is defined by the timegrid of the pulse excitation. On a second timescale a timestep for the phase of electron-phonon equilibration is defined, approximated by a timeframe of 5 ps after pulse excitation. On larger timescales, where the dynamics are governed by diffusion processes, a larger timestep of evaluation is chosen to improve compuation performance and memory usage. In certain parameter constillations of heat capacity, layer thickness and diffusion coefficients, the solver may still use a timestep too large for the computation of increments independent of the timesteps of evaluation, leading to unphysical simulation results. To prevent this, the maximum timestep for computation can be adapted. To optimize simulation performance, this maximum timestep should be adapted towards the effects of diffusion, usually a $max\\_step$ of 100 fs suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sovler provides a two-dimensional solution of the evolution of the initilial one-dimensional input array over all the timesteps of evaluation, defined manually as described above. To save this output in a way that makes results intuitive to handle, the output array is separated into the dynamics of the three subsystems of electronic/ phononic temperature and magnetization, which can readily computed from the spin configurations using {eq}"
